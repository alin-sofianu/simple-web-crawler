# Simple web crawler

This is a Command Line Application that runs using Node.js.

My web crawler project, for Coursera HTTP Networking course.

The purpose of this project, is to crawl a single website and then produce a report of it's internal linking structure.

This is a tool that would traditionally be used by web marketers or search engine optimization experts.

Clone the repository, install dependecies with 'npm install' then interact with it from the console.

```shell
npm start https://example.com
```

This command will crawl www.example.com, then create and display in the console the linking report.
